PROJECT: CREATING A SERVER WITH EXPRESS

With scripts practice.html and practice.js, this application serves an HTML file at the root path ("/") and handles form submissions at the "/submit" path. The form data (food item and quantity) is parsed from the POST request body using the body-parser middleware, and the entered data is then displayed in the response.
